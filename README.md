## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts house prices based on various property features such as location, size, condition, and amenities. The model achieved an **83.47% accuracy** using XGBoost regression with carefully selected features.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Multiple ML Algorithms**: Comparison of 16+ regression models
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Creation of house age and renovation age features
- **Outlier Detection**: Multiple techniques including Z-Score, IQR, and Isolation Forest
- **Correlation Analysis**: Removal of highly correlated features (>0.8 correlation)
- **Feature Selection**: XGBoost feature importance analysis for optimal model performance
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search optimization for best model parameters

## üìà Dataset Information

**Source**: King County House Sales Dataset  
**Records**: 21,613 house sales  
**Features**: 21 original features (reduced to 9 key features)  
**Target Variable**: House price (USD)

### Original Features:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `date`: Sale date
- `price`: Sale price (target variable)
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living`: Living area square footage
- `sqft_lot`: Lot size square footage
- `floors`: Number of floors
- `waterfront`: Waterfront property (0/1)
- `view`: Quality of view (0-4)
- `condition`: Property condition (1-5)
- `grade`: Overall grade (1-13)
- `sqft_above`: Above ground square footage
- `sqft_basement`: Basement square footage
- `yr_built`: Year built
- `yr_renovated`: Year renovated
- `zipcode`: ZIP code
- `lat`: Latitude
- `long`: Longitude
- `sqft_living15`: Living area of nearest 15 neighbors
- `sqft_lot15`: Lot size of nearest 15 neighbors

## üîß Data Preprocessing

### Feature Engineering
- **House Age**: `age = sale_year - year_built`
- **Renovation Age**: `renov_age = |year_renovated - year_built|`
- **Date Formatting**: Extracted year from sale date

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (filled with 0)
- Removed highly correlated features (correlation > 0.8)
- Applied multiple outlier detection methods

### Outlier Detection Methods
1. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Identified 1,146 outliers
2. **Z-Score Method**: Identified 406 outliers (threshold = 3)
3. **Isolation Forest**: Advanced anomaly detection

## üìä Feature Importance

Top 9 most important features selected for final model:
1. `sqft_lot` - Lot size
2. `sqft_living15` - Living area of neighbors
3. `age` - House age
4. `zipcode` - Location (ZIP code)
5. `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
6. `bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms
7. `renov_age` - Renovation age
8. `floors` - Number of floors

## üìä Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.8347 |
| **Accuracy** | 83.47% |
| **Training Method** | 7-Fold Cross Validation |
| **Final Features** | 9 selected features |

## üîç Key Insights
