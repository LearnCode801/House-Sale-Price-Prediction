## Project Overview

The project walks through the complete machine learning workflow:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration** - Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the structure and nature of the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning and transforming data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Selecting and engineering features that improve model performance.
4. **Model Training** - Training various machine learning models to find the best fit for predicting sale prices.
5. **Model Evaluation** - Evaluating models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need Python and several key libraries. You can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Ensure that Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab is installed to open and interact with the `.ipynb` file.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LearnCode801/House-Sale-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd House-Sale-Price-Prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FSDS_Sales_Forcast.ipynb
   ```
4. Run each cell in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and train models for predicting house sale prices.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis and visualization of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Training and Tuning**: Several models are explored, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
- **Evaluation and Comparison**: Models are evaluated and compared based on performance metrics, guiding you toward the best model for house sale price prediction.
